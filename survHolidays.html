                    <h3><i>Left 4 Dead 2</i> Campaign</h3>
                    <p>Surviving the Holidays is a single-map campaign that I made for Valve's <i>Left 4 Dead 2</i>. It is playable in campaign, versus, survival, and scavenge modes. It took me an entire 
                        year to make, but some lag-issues aside, I'm quite proud of how it turned out, and I think it is one of the prettiest-looking implementation of Source Engine that I've seen. Does it 
                        have lag problems in places? Yes. Some of them are because Source Engine was never designed to support wide-open, high-detail environments, which I only learned once I was several months 
                        deep into the design. Some of those lag problems are due to poor optimization on my part. I'm working on these alone, and I'm not a professional modeler, which makes optimization tough 
                        in Source Engine. <br><br>On rare occasions there is also a problem that causes severe, slide-show-esque lag, but it appears to be related to Source's audio system, and short of stripping all of the music out of 
                        the level, I may not be able to fix it. If you do know how to fix it, please leave me a comment, because I really would like to know how.<br><br>
