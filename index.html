            <h1>Jon Whitley</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm Jon. I'm an Author, UX Designer, and Game Developer. To date I've published 2 books, as well as three custom campaigns for Valve Software's Left4Dead series of video games. 
                If you enjoy the content I put out into the world, I love to get positive feedback, so leaving a nice comment or a good review is deeply appreciated, and if you'd like to further support 
                my work, you may do so by chipping in to support my coffee habit here: [Insert URL Here], but please, do not feel obligated to do so. That you would appreciate my work or share my work with 
                others, is already a great privilege. I hope you enjoy it!

                <h2>Books</h2>
                <p>I have written and published two books (so far, both children's books). Both are lightly illustrated, and both are direct-published and available in either print or e-book form. 
                    I owe a debt of gratitude to Apple Books, Kindle Direct Publishing, Barnes and Noble, and Rakuten Kobo for providing me with the means of self-publication. Please, pick up a copy if you can, 
                    read them, love them, share them with your family. Thank you!</p>

                <h2>Left 4 Dead 2</h2>
                <p>I have spent more time than I care to admit playing and building campaigns for Left 4 Dead, and I take pride in the fact that while my campaigns might not be the smoothest or the most stable,
                    they are all very distinctive in terms of visuals and experience. I really have put a ton of effort into them, and every one of these campaigns took several months of relentless work to complete. <br>
                    Every time I finish one I swear I'm never going to do it again, but, well, here we are 3 deep, and I will neither confirm nor deny that another campaign is in the works.

                <h2>Counterstrike: Global Offensive</h2>
                <p>I also produced a couple of community maps for Valve's CounterStrike: Global Offensive, several years back. They came along comparatively early in my modding career, so they may not have the same 
                    level of polish, but so far as CS:GO community maps go, I still feel like they stand out for their atmosphere.
